# Event Scheduling System (OOP Assignment 1 & 2)

## Description
This project is a console-based Java application developed as a continuation of Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.
The system models an Event Scheduling System, allowing the management of events, participants, and organizers.
It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, as well as data management operations such as searching, filtering, and sorting.

---

## Technical Implementation
The project fulfills the following assignment requirements:

### 1. OOP Principles
* Encapsulation:
  All class fields are private or protected and accessed through public methods.
* Abstraction:
  The `Person` class is implemented as an abstract class to generalize common properties.
* Inheritance:
  `Participant` and `Organizer` classes inherit from the abstract `Person` class.
* Polymorphism:
  Overriding methods such as `getRole()` and `toString()` demonstrate runtime polymorphism.

---

### 2. Data Management
* Data Pool:
  Uses `ArrayList<Event>` to store and manage multiple events dynamically.
* Searching:
  Allows searching for events by title.
* Filtering:
  Enables filtering events by location.
* Sorting:
  Implements sorting of events based on the number of participants.
* Console Output:
  Displays events and system functionality through console output.

---

### 3. Standard Java Methods
* Overridden `toString()` method for readable object output.
* Overridden `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for correct object comparison.

---

## Project Structure
* `Main.java` — Entry point of the application. Demonstrates all system functionality.
* `Person.java` — Abstract base class representing a person.
* `Participant.java` — Entity class representing an event participant.
* `Organizer.java` — Entity class representing an event organizer.
* `Event.java` — Entity class representing an event and its participants.
* `EventManager.java` — Manages the event data pool, searching, filtering, and sorting logic.

---

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Ensure all `.java` files are located in the `src` folder.
3. Run the `Main` class.
4. Observe the output in the console.

## Assignment Coverage
* Assignment 1:
  * Classes, constructors, and object creation
  * Encapsulation and basic OOP structure
  * Console output and object comparison
* Assignment 2:
  * Abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism
  * Data pooling with collections
  * Searching, filtering, and sorting
  * Overriding standard Java methods
